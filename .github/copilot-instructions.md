# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Context & Goals
- **Purpose**: Learning-focused coding assistance, not code generation
- **Objective**: Regain manual coding skills and AI independence
- **Domain**: Matrix computations research with performance focus

## Technical Constraints
- **Languages**: Python (primary), C (future)
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Matplotlib only
- **Approach**: Algorithmic thinking, avoid high-level abstractions

## Response Format
- Provide **instructive code blocks**, not full solutions
- Show **native/efficient** function usage patterns
- Include **algorithmic explanations** when relevant
- Explain **underlying mechanisms** for key operations
- Focus on **performance-oriented** implementations

## What NOT to do
- Don't write complete applications
- Don't assume full code context (normal if missing)
- Don't use external libraries beyond specified ones
- Don't provide "magic" solutions without explanation
